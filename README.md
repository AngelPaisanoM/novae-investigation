# novae-investigation
This repository holds some of the relevant subjects, equations and models implied in novae, from the binary system in quiescent state, to the outburst with blast interactions and late stages of the remnnant. The main objetive is to study and organize my notes about the processes involed in novae, and also have a bank of information to get closer to understand the physics behind those amazing processes, taking particular interest in the symbiotic recurrent systems, as T CrB or RS oph, and in order to do that, we have diferent documents with the distinct subjects related to novae.

The jupyter notebooks present here are dedicated to 1) model the time evolution of variables 2) estimate the values of mass loss and accretion rates 3) estimate the relevant timescales associated to the problem.
